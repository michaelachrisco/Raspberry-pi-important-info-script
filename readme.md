script for raspberry pi to get basic info from the system. 

Will add more features/make it look nicer later on. 

Right now, it scans the system for a snapshot of:
* CPU usage
* RAM usage
* temperature
* network info

The output should look like:
 
PI-INFO:
********************
CPU: 1% used
RAM: Total: 184MB Used: 163MB Free: 21MB
temp=44.4'C
